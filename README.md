## Programming Test

### Objective
Add the following modifiers for the “Shooter Game” example project, which is available for free download from the Epic Games Marketplace.

### Modifiers List

- **Jetpack**:
  - Players have an energy pool that allows them to fly, simulating the use of a jetpack.
  - The energy pool recharges when not in use and is displayed on the HUD.

- **Wall Jump**:
  - Players can perform a lateral jump when flying close to a wall.
  - This jump pushes the player away from the wall and slightly higher.

- **Freezing Gun**:
  - When an opponent is hit with this weapon, they are frozen and unable to move or shoot for a set period.
  - Adding a visual effect to represent the freezing is encouraged.

- **Drop Weapon**:
  - When a player is killed, they drop their weapon with the remaining ammo.
  - The dropped weapon remains in the game for a limited time before disappearing.
